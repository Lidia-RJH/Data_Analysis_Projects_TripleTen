#Project Requirements

## Part 1 - Data Cleaning and Preparation
* Explore the data from the NYC Airbnb dataset, review the data dictionary, and identify potential data cleaning challenges.   
* Document the data cleaning steps in a separate tab, including versions and updates to the final project.   
* Clean neighborhood labels (e.g., correct inconsistent text cases, remove trailing spaces).   
* Filter out listings not relevant to the analysis, such as properties with no reviews in the last 12 months or long-term rentals with a minimum stay over 7 days.      

## Part 2 - Aggregations and Pivot Table Analysis
* Create pivot tables to calculate occupancy rates and identify trends such as the top 10 neighborhoods for vacation rentals and the most popular property sizes.   
* Standardize empty bedroom fields to zeros for studio apartments and create a new column for clean bedroom data.   
* Aggregate data to calculate average occupancy, including adding a column to convert availability into numeric values (e.g., 0 for False, 1 for True).   

## Part 3 - Data Visualization
* Create bar charts to visualize occupancy rates by day of the week.   
* Use visualizations to demonstrate insights such as the most popular days for rental activity and property preferences in specific neighborhoods.   

## Part 4 - Documentation and Presentation
* Document all data cleaning steps and assumptions clearly (e.g., removing luxury listings, using reviews as a proxy for rental activity).   
* Organize and format the spreadsheet with consistent font styles, colors, borders, and hidden columns for clarity.   
* Prepare an executive summary and a table of contents to navigate the spreadsheet easily.   
* Share the final spreadsheet with clear access permissions for reviewers.
