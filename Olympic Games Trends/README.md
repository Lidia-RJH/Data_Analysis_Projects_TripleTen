# Olympic Games Trend Analysis - The Evolution of Gender Equity.  

## Project Overview 
This project was part of the Code Pudding challenge hosted by TripleTen. Alongside 2 other teammates, I studied the trends and athlete performance during the last 124 years of the Olympic Games. The visualization and data analysis presented below are my individual contributions to the challenge. 
 **Note**: Some iterations were made to the EDA and visualizations after the challenge completion, based on judge feedback and recommendations.

## Data
The dataset contains information on sports analysis in various ways spanning 124 years. Data source: Kaggle.com
* `all_athletes_games` (Primary/Main file): Register of Olympics Saga/History

## Description
- Delivered a 7-page Tableau workbook as my individual contribution to the Code Pudding challenge hosted by TripleTen. 
- In this document, you'll find: female participation trends in the Olympic games, performance analysis between genders, and athlete participation by country and gender. 

## Assumptions 
- Data reflects female and male participation distinguishing between summer and winter Olympics. 
- Data records from 1896 to 1900 show no female participation due to restrictive female participation policies at the time.

## Process 
1. Explored and cleaned the data. 
2. Story ideation, choosing insights to build a story around data. 
3. Built structure around the questions I wanted to answer with this dataset. 
4. Joined tables in Tableau, and built data visualizations
5. Analyzed the data through visualizations, and a measures and dimensions comparison to identify trends. 
6. Built dashboards to convey and present the information. 

## Findings 
**Participating Athletes per Country and Gender Ratio**
- Eastern European countries show strong female representation relative to their total delegations.
- The USA leads in both overall athlete participation and gender diversity, reflecting its investment in promoting gender equity in sports.

**Evolution in Female Athletes' Performance (1900 - 2020)**
- Female athletes have shown a dramatic rise in performance and participation since the mid-20th century.
- The growth of female medalists, especially after 1972, highlights the impact of gender equality initiatives in sports.
- Male athletes continue to maintain a high medal count, though the rate of increase is more gradual.

**Percentage of Female Athletes in Original Summer Events (1900 - 2020)** 
- Diving and Gymnastics saw the highest rates of female participation early on, reaching 40-50%.
- Athletics and Swimming showed consistent growth post-1960, indicating increased female inclusion in traditionally male-dominated sports.
- Cycling lagged in female participation but saw rapid growth after 1980.
- The 1980s mark a major shift toward closing the gender gap across all sports.

## Recommendations
In conclusion, the Olympics has made significant progress towards gender balance, with a consistent upward trend in female participation across all sports. However, disparities still exist between countries and sports, signaling that while progress has been made, there is still work to be done in achieving full gender equality.   

Some of the recommended initiatives to improve the situation include:
- Increasing Funding and Support for Female Athletes.   
- Encouraging young girls to participate in sports from an early age through school programs, and community clubs, to mention a couple.   
- Enhancing Media Coverage of Womenâ€™s Sports.   
- Create Policies to Close the Gender Gap in Underrepresented Sports.
