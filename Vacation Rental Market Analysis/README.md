# Vacation Rental Market Consulting

## Project Overview
I completed a project analyzing the vacation rental market in Manhattan using Airbnb listing data. The goal was to identify property types with the best investment potential. I utilized advanced spreadsheet techniques to analyze pricing trends, property types, and occupancy rates, providing actionable insights to guide their investment strategy.

## Data
The dataset contains information about the vacation rental market in the Manhattan borough of New York City from Airbnb listings. The data was provided by TripleTen as a Google spreadsheet file. 

## Description
- Delivered a 14-page spreadsheet document
- In this document, you'll find organizational tabs, raw data, processed data, pivot tables for data analysis, and bar charts. 

## Assumptions 
- Only short-term listings were considered for the Manhattan vacation rental analysis. 
- Only properties with a minimum night requirement of 7 days or fewer were considered. 
- Listings with no reviews from the last 12 months are most likely inactive. 
- Only properties with high review ratings were considered. 
- Super luxury or extremely low-priced listings were filtered out. 
- Calculated the annual revenue for the top five neighborhoods with 1 bedroom. 

## Process
1. Explored, organized, and cleaned the data, documenting every step of the process.
2. Filtered data based on requirements. 
3. Performed calculations, and aggregate functions to determine the properties that should be considered as a potential investment. 
4. Built pivot tables and charts to determine occupancy rates weekday, and estimated revenue. 
5. Optimized the document formatting and finalized analysis documentation for stakeholder's readability and understanding. 

## Findings 
- One-bedroom apartments in the top five neighborhoods with availability on Thursdays will likely provide an annual revenue of $75,903.31 with an average price per night of $307.47. 
- The top five neighborhoods in order include Lower East Side, Hells Kitchen, Harlem, Midtown, and Upper West Side. 
- Thurday has the highest occupancy rate based on the grand total percentage for each day of the week. 
- One-bedroom apartments are the most popular properties for vacation rentals.
