The dataset contains information about the vacation rental market in the Manhattan borough of New York City from AirBnB listings. The data was provided by TripleTen on Google spreadsheet. 

## Description

## Assumtions 
- Only short-term listings were considered for the Manhattan vacation rental analysis. 
- Only properties with a minimum night requirement of 7 days or fewer were considered. 
- Listings with no reviews from the last 12 months are most likely innactive. 
- Only properties with high review ratings were considered. 
- Super luxury or extremely low-priced listings were filtered out. 
- Calculated the annual revenue for the top five neighborhoods with 1 bedroom only. 

## Process
1. Explored, organized, and cleaned the data, documenting every step of the process.
2. Filtered data based on requirements. 
3. Performed calculations, and aggregate functions to determine the properties that should be considered as an investement. 
4. Built pivot tables and charts to determine occupancy rates week day, and estimated revenue. 
5. Optimized the documents formatting and finalized analysis documentation for stakeholder's readabiliy and understanding. 

## Findings 
- One-bedroom apartments in the top five neighborhoods with availability on Thursdays will likely provide an annual revenue of $75,903.31 with an average price per night of $307.47. 
- The top five neighborhoods in order include: Lower East Side, Hells Kitchen, Harlem, Midtown and Upper West Side.
